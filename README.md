# leaf-disease-Detection-Matlab
This project aims to detect diseases in plant leaves using image processing techniques in MATLAB. It focuses on identifying common diseases such as rust, blight, and mold, which can significantly impact crop yields. The system uses image segmentation, feature extraction, and classification to accurately diagnose the diseases.



# Leaf Disease Detection using MATLAB
This project aims to detect diseases in plant leaves using image processing techniques in MATLAB. It focuses on identifying common diseases such as rust, blight, and mold, which can significantly impact crop yields. The system uses image segmentation, feature extraction, and classification to accurately diagnose the diseases.

# Features
Image segmentation to isolate the leaf area from the background.
Feature extraction to extract relevant features such as color, texture, and shape.
Classification using machine learning algorithms to classify the disease based on extracted features.
User-friendly interface for easy interaction and visualization of results.

# Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leaf-disease-detection-matlab.git
Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
